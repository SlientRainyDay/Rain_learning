	abstract = {Today, unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) are very popular not only among {IT} people, but also among the public. In addition to being able to shoot or take photos from different perspectives and being a means of entertainment, they are also a great source of data. {UAVs} collect, store and send data to other devices, usually to smartphones or laptops. Smartphones or laptops also send information about changing of location or different commands to the {UAV}. But is the data transfer to/from the {UAV} well secured? Can we trust the data transfer between control station and {UAV}, or is data exposed to potential misuse?Our work deals with the issue of security of data transfer in the field of {UAV}. In the field of small drones, one of the most used protocols is the Micro Air Vehicle Link protocol ({MAVLink} protocol in short). This protocol enables the exchange of a small amount of data between the control station and the {UAV}.The work presents chosen attacks on {UAV} data transfer and chosen security mechanisms. Overall, four attacks were performed - Bluesnarfing, Bluesmacking, The ’open sesame bug’ and Blesa. Security mechanisms are designed to protect against specific attacks. Based on the studied information, selected attacks were performed. Then, every attack has an overview of defense mechanisms whose aims are detection of attacks and a reduction of their impact. Finally, a suggestion is provided, on how to approach current threats in the field of {UAV}.},

	doi = {10.1109/SIBCON56144.2022.10002947},
	abstract = {the purpose of this study is to analyze and study threats and vulnerabilities in Unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}), as well as to assess the impact of attacks on the functional characteristics of {UAVs} and their behavior. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were formulated: the study of current threats and vulnerabilities in {UAVs}, the study and selection of testing tools for instrumental analysis of the security of {UAV} control protocols, the analysis of external and internal attacks for testing {UAVs}, the study of the consequences of attacks, the analysis of the security of protocols, based on the results of the attacks. The relevance of the work lies in the fact that the results obtained after completing these tasks will help to expand the methods for detecting attacks for {UAVs}. A change in the behavior of the {UAV}, under the influence of various attacks, may indicate anomalous activity. By comparing the behavior of the {UAV} under normal conditions and when carrying out an attack on the data communication network, it is possible to prove that the attack has a significant impact on the functioning of the {UAV}. In addition, the results of the work will allow us to determine which of the possible ways of implementing attacks is more rational and efficient. The main practical results of the work were a list of possible attacks and recommendations for their implementation, thanks to which it is possible in practice to analyze the security of specific {UAVs}.},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}), or the so-called drones, have been used in various applications. In particular, {UAVs} are used for rescue systems, disaster detection, and military purposes, as well as for leisure and commercial purposes. {UAVs} that are controlled over networks by ground control stations ({GCS}) can provide various services with expanded activity area. It is thus of critical importance to investigate the vulnerability of the drone system. In this paper, we focus on {UAVs} controlled by {GCS} over networks. We analyze the vulnerability of the micro-air-vehicle communication ({MAVLink}) protocol, which is one of the most widely adopted communication protocols for {GCS}-based control of {UAVs}. Then, by exploiting the vulnerability of the {MAVLink} protocol, we propose an attack methodology that can disable an ongoing mission of a {UAV}. Our empirical study confirms that the proposed attack can stop the attacked {UAV} and disable the mission.},
